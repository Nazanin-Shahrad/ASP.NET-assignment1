    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>
        Before starting her cake journey, Nazanin specialized in graphic design, drawing/painting and photography. After becoming a mom, she wanted to try a new adventure by combining all of her skill-sets into cake art. After countless hours of practice and experimenting, Sona decided to only create custom & unique designs for each client matching each individual style and character.

        LiMa Cakes, named after Sona's daughters, Lily (Li) & Maya (Ma), is a vision that came to fruition when Nazanin started to use her drawing skills and graphic design background to come up with visionary sketches to later turn into cake art, also using her photography talent to snap those beauties into memory.
