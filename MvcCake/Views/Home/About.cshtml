        Before starting her cake journey, Nazanin specialized in Telecommunication industry. After becoming a mom, she wanted to try a new adventure
        by combining all of her skill-sets into cake art. After countless hours of practice and experimenting,
        Nazanin decided to only create custom & unique designs for each client matching each
        individual style and character.
